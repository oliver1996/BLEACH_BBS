<title>Wimpy Player - Example 4</title>


<!-- Wimpy Engine -->
<!-- NOTE: This should be located in between the opening <head> and closing </head> tags. -->
<script src="wimpy.js"></script>

<!-- Create Wimpy Player with Target.
Note how we can create a player here 
(in the HEAD), yet still render the 
player in the body. This is because
we are using the "target" option. -->
<script>
var myPlayer = new wimpyPlayer({
	target 		: "myPlayerTarget", // This is identical tot eh "id" in the DIV below.
	media		: "song1.mp3",
	skin 		: "wimpy.skins/041.tsv",
	startUpText : "Hello"
});
</script>

<body>



<p>IMPORTANT: The player will only work properly on a live web server!</p>

<!-- Wimpy Player Target -->
<div id="myPlayerTarget"></div>
