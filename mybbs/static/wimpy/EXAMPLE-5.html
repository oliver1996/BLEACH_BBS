<p>IMPORTANT: The player will only work properly on a live web server!</p>

<iframe src="wimpy.iframe.html?skin=wimpy.skins/301.tsv&startUpText=Hello There Earthling" width="300" height="350" frameborder="0" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>The wimpy-iframe.html file is a special file that allows you to include wimpy player in another page (or web site) in an isolated manor.</p>
<p>Player options are configured with a ?query string tacked on to the end of the URL to the special wimpy.iframe.html file.</p>
<p>Note that when using an iframe, you do not need to include a reference to the wimpy.js engine.</p>
